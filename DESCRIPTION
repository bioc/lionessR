Title: Modeling networks for individual samples using LIONESS
Version: 0.99.2
Description: LIONESS, or Linear Interpolation to Obtain Network Estimates for Single Samples, can be used to reconstruct single-sample networks (https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06440). This code implements the LIONESS equation in the lioness function in R to reconstruct single-sample networks. The default network reconstruction method we use is based on Pearson correlation. However, lionessR can run on any network reconstruction algorithms that returns a complete, weighted adjacency matrix. lionessR works for both unipartite and bipartite networks.
